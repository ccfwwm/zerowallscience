/**
 * Package-manifest regression test for the DSH web loader contract. The rc.1
 * loader composes a bundle's browser half only when package.json declares
 * `dsh.client` (platform "web") beside `dsh.bundle.patch`, and resolves the
 * entries through `exports` (which wins over `main`). Losing the client block
 * loads the host half silently while every client mount point vanishes — the
 * SSH tab button, the terminal drawer and the settings resources tab all
 * disappear from a freshly loaded web UI (2026-09-03 rc.1 upgrade regression).
