/**
 * The reviewer child's context firewall.
 *
 * The reviewer is an ordinary agent, so the harness composes its steps the
 * ordinary way: the loop's own runtime-context snapshot, the workspace
 * instruction files (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, injected by
 * `dsh-agent-instructions`), and every context-injecting plugin the user
 * happens to have installed all enter the child ABOVE the reviewer prompt.
 * None of that is evidence about the reviewed call, and the workspace half is
 * authored by whoever can write to the repository under review — a teammate, a
 * PR branch, a dependency shipping its own `AGENTS.md` — which puts
 * repository-controlled text inside the component that decides whether a
 * privileged operation is allowed, above a prompt that says "judge the call
 * from the evidence below ONLY".
 *
 * This injection is NOT a property of the subagent provider: the same request
 * under `fork` and under `spawn` was measured to produce byte-identical
 * injected context, because these producers inject fresh into any new agent
 * session. Choosing a non-seeding provider does not avoid them; this filter is
 * what closes them, under either provider.
 *
 * The subagent seam has no "bare child" construction: `SubagentStartRequest`
 * scopes the child's TOOLS (`toolFilter`) and its persona, not the messages
 * that enter its steps. `agent/pre-step` is the documented seam for exactly
 * that — "reject a proposed step or replace the messages that enter it" — and
 * it is the last waterfall before the loop appends those messages to the
 * child's log, so filtering there keeps the reviewer's own session log an
 * honest record of what it saw.
 *
 * The filter is an ALLOW-LIST over message sources, like `reviewerTools` is an
 * allow-list over tools: a source this module does not know about is dropped,
 * so a plugin that merges a new `MessageSource` kind cannot reach the reviewer
 * by being new.
