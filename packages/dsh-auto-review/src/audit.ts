 * Host-capability detection for the `ignorable` audit-envelope marker.
 *
 * `Session.append(type, data, { ignorable: true })` stamps the envelope
 * marker on host builds that expose the surface (post-rc.6
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session`); the `0.1.0-rc.6` line silently drops the
 * options bag, so audit events land unmarked and stricter hosts refuse to
 * resume those sessions (`SessionFormatUnsupportedError`). Host master
 * `0.1.2-alpha.2` keeps the `ignorable` field on the event envelope but
 * offers no append option to write it — the third parameter is
 * `SurfaceIntent`, accepted only for surface event types — so `append`
 * never stamps the marker there either. The runtime detects the host
 * before polluting a log: the installed peer version is checked against
 * the known-unmarked lines first, and an unknown (unresolvable) version is
 * verified by probing the FIRST appended event's returned envelope. The
 * same discipline lives in `dsh-permission-rules` (its `AuditAppend` /
 * `isMarkedAuditEvent` pair).
