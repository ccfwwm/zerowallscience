# DSH SSH Ops

> An SSH operations plugin for DeepSeek Harness: drive the current server from the main conversation while keeping a real interactive terminal on the right, with built-in file management, port forwarding, and database management.

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
![DSH](https://img.shields.io/badge/DeepSeek%20Harness-plugin-blue)
![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3.8-blue)

> **v0.3.8**: follows the DSH plugin-market convention by declaring host compatibility only through the four official-package `peerDependencies`, covering the `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.2`, `0.1.5-alpha.1`, and validated `0.1.6-alpha.1` prerelease lines; removes the market-unused `engines.dsh` declaration so there is one compatibility contract.

> **v0.3.5**: removes the no-longer-maintained Operations preset installer so npm no longer creates an invalid command entry; saved SSH resources can now open a default remote project directory in both the terminal and SFTP.

> **New in v0.3.4**: **each split pane now gets its own connection** — opening the same server in two panes creates two independent transports, terminals and working directories instead of mirroring one terminal; tick "reuse the open connection" in the connect dialog to share one on purpose. The **pane the agent is acting on is now visible and switchable**, marked with a blue robot badge — click another pane to re-target it. **Peers whose SSH identification string does not follow RFC 4253 can now connect**: when a device writes it malformed (a stray space in `SSH-2.0- OpenSSH`, or `SSH-2.1-`), ssh2 previously failed with a bare `Invalid identification string` that named neither the device nor the reason; the plugin now retries once and normalizes that single line (the peer's software version is preserved and no crypto is weakened), while a genuinely unusable banner reports the peer's own bytes. Also fixes connecting from the settings page not opening or loading the SSH pane. Shared credentials, jump hosts, connection reuse and the terminal theme from 0.3.3 remain. See **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)** for desktop install instructions.

## Compatibility

- **Target host**: the DSH Desktop / Web Profile `0.1.6` line; the current development environment is compatible with `0.1.6-alpha.1`. The plugin uses DSH's bundled Node.js runtime and does not require a system `ssh`, `sftp`, or standalone Node.js installation.
- **Current right Sidebar**: when the host supplies both `sidebarRightTabs` and `sidebarRight`, SSH runs as an official right-Sidebar tab and uses the host's split, resize, and fullscreen behavior.
- **Older-host fallback**: if those Sidebar APIs are absent, the plugin automatically keeps the earlier floating SSH panel. Terminal, SFTP, tunnels, databases, and agent tools remain available, but there is no official Sidebar-tab or split-pane experience.
- **File byte streaming**: browser upload/download routes register only when the Web Profile exposes both `webServer` and the request-origin guard; hosts without them retain the existing SFTP operations. Directory archive download returns `501 archive-unavailable` on every host, preventing traversal across differing SFTP-chroot and SSH-shell filesystem namespaces.
- **Upgrades**: fully quit and restart the affected DSH Profile after installing or upgrading. SSH resources, known hosts, and credentials live in DSH-owned local storage outside the plugin package, so a normal upgrade does not remove them.

## Screenshots

Drive the connected server from the main conversation while the interactive SSH terminal sits beside it as an official right-Sidebar tab:

The Files tab provides SFTP management and can `cd` the interactive terminal into the selected remote directory:

## What it does

- **Official right-Sidebar integration (current DSH)**: the SSH terminal is a tab of the official right Sidebar, beside the built-in Files tab. The **SSH** button in the conversation header opens or focuses that tab (repeated clicks focus instead of duplicating). Use the official split view to see files and the terminal together; drag-resize, fullscreen, and collapse are the sidebar's, and the terminal re-fits automatically. **Each split pane is independent**: it keeps its own visible servers and selection, a new pane starts empty and never inherits another pane's servers, opening the same server in both panes gives each its own connection (reuse is opt-in), closing it in one pane leaves the other alone, and the host session is disconnected only once no pane shows it any more. The connection the agent is using carries an **Agent** badge — click the other pane to move the agent there. **Connection lifetime is independent of the tab**: switching tabs, collapsing the sidebar, closing the tab, or switching chats never disconnects SSH; terminal instances live in a client-side pool, so reopening restores the full scrollback while host-buffered output from the hidden period replays on return. Older DSH builds (no `sidebarRightTabs`) fall back to the floating panel unchanged.
- **Terminal follows DSH's theme**: xterm draws to its own canvas and cannot inherit the CSS text color, so the plugin ships complete light and dark palettes (cursor and selection included) and repaints open terminals as soon as the host theme changes.
- Manage any number of servers and groups under **Settings → SSH Resources**. It is a first-class left-menu item beside General and Models, not a Plugins sub-tab. The top **SSH** button only opens or focuses the right-side terminal tab (on older DSH it shows/hides the floating panel — neither disconnects).
- **Saved remote project directory**: a server resource can hold one optional absolute default project path. **Enter project** connects, opens the terminal, changes directory only after the existing idle-shell/single-PTY guard succeeds, and starts SFTP at the same path. Relative paths and control characters are rejected; resources without a project path retain the normal login-directory and SFTP-root behavior.
- **Command library**: the SSH panel has a dedicated Command Library tab with system inspection, service, Docker, logs, networking, storage, scheduler, and Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS install/update templates. Search matches command names and contents. Custom commands are managed inside this tab; they are stored only in browser local storage and must never contain passwords, tokens, or other secrets.
- Server name, address, port, username, auth type, and group are stored in DSH local storage; there is no count limit.
- Passwords, PEM private keys, and passphrases are stored **only** in DSH's official local credentials store `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (owner-only permissions). Browser storage, agent context, tool results, and resource lists never read or display secrets.
- **Shared credentials**: one password or private key can be saved as a shared credential and referenced by many servers and jump hosts (for example one operations key for a whole group, so a change lands everywhere at once). Deletion is refused while any server or jump chain still references it, and the secret is resolved host-side and handed straight to the SSH client — never into browser storage or agent context. Manage them under **Settings → SSH Resources**, where you can pick a PEM file or drop one into the dialog. Each server may bind a shared credential or keep its own dedicated one.
- **ProxyJump**: jump hosts are chosen from your saved servers instead of typed by hand, and passwords/keys/passphrases all come from the credential store; a jump host can reference a shared credential too. Saving and connecting reject a server that jumps through itself, a duplicate hop, or a missing resource. A chain holds up to 8 hops.
- **One channel per pane by default**: opening the same saved server in both split panes creates two independent connections — two channels, two terminals, no interference, each keeping its own working directory. Tick **reuse the open connection** in the connect dialog to share instead: this pane joins the live connection and shares its single terminal (useful when you want to watch the agent work in that same shell).
- **The agent's target is visible and switchable**: the connection the agent is using carries an **Agent** badge. Click the other pane's server tab or terminal area to move the agent there — agent tools that omit `connection_id` (`ssh_exec`, `sftp_*`, `tunnel_*`, safety confirmation cards) resolve to it. Switching to a connection that is gone is refused and leaves the previous binding intact, so the agent is never silently left with no target.
- The main conversation auto-detects the currently-connected server on the right; the agent never has to ask the user for an internal connection id.
- Commands run through `ssh_exec` are echoed in the terminal and return exit code, output, `cwd`, duration, timeout, and truncation state. On Linux, the command inherits the verified directory of one idle POSIX interactive shell. Busy or ambiguous terminals and inaccessible directories are rejected; when no interactive shell is detectable, the login directory is used and clearly reported.
- Manual terminal output is read on demand via `ssh_read`; it is never silently injected into the conversation context.
- Output sent to the model is redacted for private keys, Bearer tokens, common passwords/API keys (including bare `sk-`-prefixed keys), and database passwords.
- **Connection stability**: SSH connections enable keepalive (20s interval, 3 checks), so NAT/firewalls no longer silently drop idle connections. Transport drops trigger exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (capped at 30s); a command that drops mid-run is retried once transparently. Transient connection failures auto-retry 3 times (auth failures excluded). Explicit disconnect or plugin unload never triggers reconnect; remote tunnels re-register automatically after a reconnect.
- **Host-key verification (TOFU)**: SSH connections verify the server's host public-key fingerprint — first connect records and trusts it, later changes are rejected (guards against MITM / re-provisioned servers). Per-server `hostKeyMode` selects `accept-new` (default) / `verify` (reject unseen) / `off`; on a changed fingerprint the connection is **not retried and not auto-reconnected**. Settings → SSH Resources lets you set the mode per server and manage trusted fingerprints with one-click forget. Verification runs before user authentication, so it is independent of who logs in or which password they use — the same server with an unchanged key never blocks another admin or vendor.
- **File management**: a Files tab in the SSH panel browses the server's filesystem over SFTP with upload, download, mkdir, delete, and rename. The `sftp_*` tools can also be used directly in the conversation.
- **Port forwarding**: a Tunnels tab starts local forwards (this machine → server-reachable target) and remote forwards (server → this machine), with a live tunnel list and stop control. The `tunnel_*` tools can also be used directly.
- **Multi-server batch**: say "batch exec <command>" in the conversation and the agent creates a batch task; the SSH panel pops a selection dialog listing **all saved servers (including not-yet-connected ones)** from SSH Resources for you to tick, then runs it concurrently after confirmation (each via its saved credentials: connect → run → disconnect), presenting results grouped per server (green success / red failure). The batch target is completely independent of the currently-open connection. When the command hits the safety policy, it is confirmed once as "command + N targets" rather than per-server. The legacy `ssh_cluster` (which fanned out over open connections with no confirmation) has been removed entirely: multi-server work goes only through `ssh_batch`'s operator-ticked confirmation, so a one-server request can never silently hit every connection.
- **Databases**: a Database tab connects to MySQL / PostgreSQL / Redis / MongoDB, runs SQL queries or commands manually, and shows results in a table. The `db_*` tools can also be used directly.
  - `db_connect` auto-tunnels over SSH: once a server is connected, loopback hosts (127.0.0.1 / localhost / ::1) are automatically tunneled through the current server to reach intranet databases. `via_ssh` selects `auto` (default) / `yes` / `no`; an explicit `ssh_connection_id` takes precedence.
  - Three SSL modes (`disabled` plain / `preferred` encrypt-without-verify / `verify` encrypt+verify-CA) for cloud-managed databases.
  - Database connections can be saved as profiles for one-click reconnect after restart; passwords are encrypted in the DSH credentials store; saved resources support renaming and collapsible grouping.
  - **Engineering loop**: `db_query` is a lexical read-only gate (only SELECT/SHOW/DESCRIBE/EXPLAIN/read-only WITH pass; write-verb subqueries, PG data-modifying CTEs, `SELECT INTO`, and `FOR UPDATE` locking reads are rejected); queries stream with a default 200-row cap and 30s timeout (`DSH_SSH_OPS_MAX_DB_ROWS` can raise the cap to 5000; use the smallest production value needed; MySQL destroys the pool connection, PG paginates via a cursor); an interactive transaction workflow `db_tx_begin/execute/commit/rollback` (dedicated connection, verify-then-commit, auto-rollback after 5 min idle); `db_describe_table` reports indexes/foreign keys/DDL/row-count and size estimates; `db_preview` paginates samples, `db_explain` shows the plan. The database panel adds a table tree, preview view, one-click CSV export (with BOM for Excel), and query history (last 50 per connection in localStorage). DB transport loss no longer crashes the process (handled uniformly across all four clients, never throwing).
  - High-risk SQL (`DROP DATABASE`/`SCHEMA`/`TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `SHUTDOWN`) is auto-blocked, detected by **statement verb** (skipping strings/comments, supporting multi-statement), so keywords inside string literals are never false-positives.

## Security boundary

DSH's own permission mechanism remains in effect. This plugin additionally stops agent tools from executing clearly irreversible or destructive operations, such as deleting files, dropping databases, formatting disks, `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete`, `docker prune`, forced Git cleanup, and reboot/shutdown.

When the agent hits the blocklist it is not silently refused: the plugin creates a one-shot **pending-confirmation** record and immediately pops a viewport-wide confirmation modal (full command, risk reason, and **Execute** / **Undo** buttons; Esc, clicking the backdrop, or "handle later in the panel" dismisses it temporarily — it closes automatically once every queued command is handled, and still-unhandled items pop up again when the panel reopens). Unhandled items also stay as cards above the SSH panel's terminal, collapsed to a one-line summary (command + host + always-visible Execute/Undo); the newest starts expanded, clicking expands the risk reason and full command. Only the operator's red **Execute** button submits the command (sending it to the server with Enter); **Undo** clears the record. The command is never pre-filled into the terminal — the input line stays empty, so the operator cannot accidentally run a blocked command by pressing Enter. Multiple dangerous commands queue independently as separate cards. If no live terminal session exists, or the command contains control characters like Tab that cannot be safely sent to a PTY, it degrades to a copyable command card returned in the conversation for the operator to paste into the terminal. Ordinary ops (configure SSL, install packages, edit configs, reload services) flow through DSH's normal permission process.

The same model covers `sftp_delete` (the agent no longer deletes directly; instead the equivalent `rm -rf <path>` is queued for confirmation) and `db_execute` high-risk SQL (`DROP`/`TRUNCATE`/`SHUTDOWN`): high-risk SQL keeps the same pattern, returning a card with a ```sql code block for the operator to paste into the database panel's SQL editor and run manually. SQL detection works by **statement verb** (skipping strings/comments, splitting on `;` for multi-statement), so keywords inside string literals are never false-positives, and high-frequency CRUD passes through normally.

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:caoyiwei850/dsh-ssh-ops#v0.3.8
```

Then restart DSH Web:

```bash
dsh web
```

Open any session, click the top **SSH** tab, and use the right-side panel to connect to a server.

### From a release archive

Download `dsh-ssh-ops-0.3.8.tgz` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caoyiwei850/dsh-ssh-ops/releases/tag/v0.3.8), then:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-ssh-ops-0.3.8.tgz
dsh web
```

`dsh-ssh-ops-0.3.8.zip` is for offline review or further development; extract it and run `npm install && npm run build` in the directory.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → SSH Resources** and create a group or server resource; PEM / `.key` files can be imported directly.
2. A saved resource can be "connect & open" to auto-create a right-side PTY terminal. When editing, leaving a secret field blank keeps the existing value; clearing credentials requires explicit confirmation.
3. The top **SSH** only toggles the right-side terminal; the `+` in the top-right picks a saved resource or creates a non-persistent temporary connection.
4. In the main conversation, just say "check server memory usage" or "configure the Nginx SSL certificate". The agent can only operate the active connection; it cannot enumerate saved resources, read credentials, or auto-connect using saved credentials.
5. For databases, have the agent call `db_connect` (or create a connection yourself in the Database tab), then query/execute from the conversation.
### Agent tools

There are 31 agent tools. Omitting `connection_id` / `db_connection_id` targets the active connection — **no need to call `ssh_list` / `db_list_connections` first**.

#### SSH (6)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ssh_list` | List open SSH connections and identify the active server; only when the user asks which is connected |
| `ssh_connect` | Connect over SSH (password or private key) and make it the current server |
| `ssh_exec` | Run a command on the current server (inherits the interactive shell's cwd); returns exit code/output/cwd/duration/timeout/truncation/redacted state |
| `ssh_read` | Read buffered output from the right-side terminal on demand (never silently injected) |
| `ssh_write` | Send interactive input to a terminal; `press_enter` (default true) appends Enter so prompts are submitted like a real keypress (use `connection_id` to target a specific server's terminal) |
| `ssh_disconnect` | Close the current connection and its shell sessions |

#### Manual terminal context (2)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ssh_terminal_sessions` | List low-sensitivity metadata and cursors for open terminals; never returns terminal content or credentials |
| `ssh_terminal_context` | After per-read user approval, read a bounded, redacted history range from a selected manually operated terminal without affecting the visible terminal scrollback |

#### SFTP (6)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sftp_list` | List remote directory entries (with size/mtime/mode) |
| `sftp_read` | Read a remote file's contents (default cap 4 MiB) |
| `sftp_write` | Write text to a remote file (create or overwrite) |
| `sftp_mkdir` | Create a remote directory |
| `sftp_delete` | Delete a remote file or empty dir (**not executed directly**; queues `rm -rf <path>` for confirmation or returns a copyable card) |
| `sftp_rename` | Rename or move a remote path |

#### Port forwarding (3)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tunnel_start` | Start a local forward (`local`, this machine → server-reachable target) or a remote forward (`remote`, server → this machine) |
| `tunnel_list` | List active tunnels |
| `tunnel_stop` | Stop a tunnel by `tunnel_id` |

#### Batch execution (1)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ssh_batch` | Create a batch task over saved servers (including not-yet-connected ones) from SSH Resources; the operator ticks targets in the panel before it is dispatched concurrently, results grouped per server — **only when the user explicitly asks for multi-server batch** (the legacy `ssh_cluster` is removed entirely; there is no confirmation-free multi-server path) |

#### Database (14)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `db_connect` | Connect to MySQL / PostgreSQL / Redis / MongoDB; loopback hosts auto-tunnel through the current SSH server; three SSL modes |
| `db_list_connections` | List open database connections (only when the user asks) |
| `db_query` | Run a **lexically enforced read-only** query on MySQL/PostgreSQL (only SELECT/SHOW/DESCRIBE/EXPLAIN/read-only WITH pass; write verbs, `SELECT INTO`, `FOR UPDATE` locking reads and data-modifying CTEs are rejected); results stream with a default 200-row cap and 30s timeout; `DSH_SSH_OPS_MAX_DB_ROWS` can raise it to at most 5000 rows; supports `?` / `$1` placeholders |
| `db_execute` | Run a write statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/ALTER); high-risk SQL (DROP/TRUNCATE/SHUTDOWN) is not executed, returns a copyable card |
| `db_list_tables` | List tables in the current schema of MySQL/PostgreSQL |
| `db_describe_table` | Full structure: columns, indexes, foreign keys, row-count/size estimates, plus MySQL `SHOW CREATE TABLE` DDL |
| `db_preview` | Paginated table sampling (bound LIMIT/OFFSET, injection-safe identifier whitelist) with a full-table row estimate — no SQL needed |
| `db_explain` | Execution plan (EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON) to check index usage |
| `db_tx_begin` / `db_tx_execute` / `db_tx_commit` / `db_tx_rollback` | Interactive transaction workflow: begin → write → SELECT-verify → commit/rollback (dedicated connection, auto-rollback after 5 min idle) |
| `db_run` | Run a command on Redis (`command`+`args`), or `find`/`findOne`/`insertOne`/`updateOne`/`deleteOne`/`countDocuments` on MongoDB |
| `db_disconnect` | Close a database connection |

> Use `db_query` for read-only SQL, `db_execute` for SQL writes, and `db_run` for Redis/MongoDB. MySQL uses `?` placeholders; PostgreSQL uses `$1` placeholders.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
npm run pack:release
```

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag that matches `package.json.version` runs tests, builds the release assets, and publishes the same tarball to npm and GitHub Releases. Configure the repository `NPM_TOKEN` secret before the first release.

Artifacts are written to `release/`:

- `dsh-ssh-ops-0.3.8.tgz`: installable directly by DSH.
- `dsh-ssh-ops-0.3.8.zip`: full offline source archive.
