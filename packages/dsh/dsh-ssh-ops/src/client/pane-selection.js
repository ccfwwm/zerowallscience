/**
 * Which servers each Sidebar pane shows. A split pane is a sibling React tree
 * over one shared host-side connection list, so this cannot be React state:
 * the dock kit renders a single-pane root as a `<TabPanel>` and a split root as
 * a `<div>`, so splitting swaps the element type at the root and REMOUNTS the
 * body. Per-instance state is lost there (the pane's server tabs vanished) and a
 * per-instance random pane id leaks a reference, which suppressed the final
 * disconnect.
 *
 * A view is therefore identified by the host's own tab id, which survives that
 * remount and disappears exactly when the tab does, and every view's state
 * lives in this module-level store. Reference counting answers one question:
 * after this view drops a connection, does any other view still show it?
