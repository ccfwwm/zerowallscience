/**
 * Keep-alive registry for xterm Terminal instances, keyed by host SSH session
 * id. The right-Sidebar draws only the ACTIVE tab's body, so switching to the
 * Files tab (or closing the SSH tab) unmounts every XtermView; without this
 * pool each unmount destroyed the scrollback, and "reopen restores the
 * terminal" was only true for output the host had buffered since.
 *
 * The pool is pure bookkeeping over factory-created terminals so it runs in
 * Node tests without DOM: `create` returns { term, fit, ...addons } and the
 * pool never touches the DOM itself — mounting/remounting (`term.element` re-parenting)
 * stays in XtermView.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - One pooled entry per session id; `acquire` marks the caller as owner.
 * - If the entry is owned by another LIVE mount (split view / two panes), the
 *   caller gets a fresh unpooled terminal instead of stealing the element;
 *   releasing an unpooled terminal disposes it.
 * - Releasing only clears ownership: scrollback survives tab switches, sidebar
 *   collapse, chat switches, and closing the SSH tab.
 * - Unowned entries beyond `max` are evicted least-recently-used and disposed;
 *   owned entries are never evicted under a live mount.
 * - `drop` disposes immediately (host session is gone: `no-session`).
 *
 * Each terminal keeps its last displayed stream offset. Identical new output
 * is retained; only explicitly overlapping offsets are skipped.
